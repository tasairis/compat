# About

The ["Detailed View"](https://tasairis.github.io/compat) site is a companion to [the SE Compatibility Tracking thread on LoversLab.com](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/94228-se-compatibility-tracking/). That thread aims to provide an overview of the most popular LoversLab (aka. "LL") mods for Skyrim Special Edition (aka. "Skyrim SE"), and even some non-LL mods, and thus misses out on a lot of compatibility information I've gathered during the years of managing it.

If you don't know what the above is talking about then you probably don't need to be here...

The Detailed View site thus aims to present a simpler but more complete view of all the data I have. Some has been gathered manually through an assortment of complicated processes, some has been collected through privately-developed automation.

## Vision

The Detailed View has some core guidelines to keep in mind:

1. Its purpose is to **allow users to find SE-compatible versions of LE mods**. In other words, the expectation is that someone will use this view by starting with an LE mod they are familiar with and finding out what is needed to have that same (or a similar) mod working in SE. This is not intended to be an "index" of mods, nor a list of "recommended" mods, nor a log of new or recent mods, or anything like that, even if it will naturally accomplish those to some degree simply by existing.
2. It is **not an alternative way to browse LL mods**. It must not, in any way, suggest itself as a better means of searching for or browsing LL. Consider it more like a primitive search engine, designed to aggregate some useful data in a single place, with the goal of helping the user get to their desired destination.
3. The site is a **minimal-effort presentation**. I don't have time to manage this in any particularly fancy way, nor would I want anyone to invest a significant amount of their time into it either. That said, a useful and perhaps even attractive interface will necessarily require some non-trivial amount of effort. Yes, this is a vague and highly subjective opinion.

# Contributing

Please consider the above "Vision" before requesting changes.

**Note that the data powering the website is actually hosted elsewhere.**

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Bug reports and feature requests are allowed.

To do so, please [create a new Issue](https://github.com/tasairis/compat/issues/new/choose) in this GitHub repository. Replies to [the LL thread](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/94228-se-compatibility-tracking/) are also acceptable. Please avoid messaging me directly unless you feel your feedback should be given privately.

Feature requests involving the quantity, nature, representation, etc. of the underlying data should be addressed here, however I will be *very* strict about what is and is not supported.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are allowed, however I will be picky about what changes are accepted. As such, I encourage you to create a feature request (or otherwise contact me) *before* submitting a pull request so that we can have a chance to discuss the idea before you start spending any time on it.

I promise that I am a reasonable person, and that my gatekeeping is not meant to be a deterrent towards contributing.

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed and technical information.
